## Configuration  
* created the following files:  
  * `README.md`  
  * `.gitignore`  
  * `.eslintrc.json`  
  * `.eslintignore`  
  * `.package.json`  
  * index.js  

* created the following directories and sub files:  
  * __test__  
    * sll.test.js  
  * lib  
    * dll.js  
    * node.js  
    * sll.js  

## Feature Tasks  
* implemented `reverse()` as a method on the Linked List prototype; from my whiteboard exercise  
* complete the Linked List data structure by adding a `removeNthNode(n)` method  
* in comments above or within each function, noted the Big-O runtime  

## Test  
* wrote tests for each method that I've written  

### stil need to  complete the Linked List data structure by adding a `removeNthNode(n)`

## Configuration
* `README.md`
* `.gitignore`
* `.eslintrc.json`
* `.eslintignore`
* `.package.json`

## Feature Tasks
* implement `reverse()` as a method on the Linked List prototype; from your whiteboard exercise
* complete the Linked List data structure by adding a `removeNthNode(n)` method
* in comments above or within each function, note the Big-O runtime

# Documentation
* Write a description on your code in your readme

## Test
* write at least three tests for each method that you've written

## Rubric 10pts
* LinkedList: 5pts
* Tests: 3pts
* Documentation & Big-O: 2pts

## Bonus Points:
  * implement `findNthNode()` as a method on the LL prototype
  * implement `findMiddleNode()` as a method on the LL prototype

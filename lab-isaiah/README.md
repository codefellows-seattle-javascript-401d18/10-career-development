# Lab10-Isaiah

### Configuration
  * `lib/` (contains `linked-list.js`)
  * `__test__/` (constains `linked-list.test.js`)
  * `.gitignore`
  * `.eslintrc.json`
  * `.eslintignore`
  * `package.json`
  * `README.md`
  * Included `server.js`

### Feature Tasks:
* Implemented `reverse()` as a method on the Linked-List as worked through vie the white-boarding exercise.
* Completed implementation of `removeNthNode(n)` method.
* Comments inputted above each function to inform of functions Big-O notation.

### Test:
* Created three tests for each function.
* Did not implement TDD for `reverse()` as function was created during white-boarding. Continued from white-boarding method implementation utilizing TDD.

### Documentation:
* The purpose of this code was to obtain a deeper understanding of the ***linked list*** data structures. In this case the focus was on understanding and handling of ***`singly` linked list data structure***.

### Bonus Points:
* Currently not attempted.

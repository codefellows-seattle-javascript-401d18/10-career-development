# Documentation:

  * What this project does:

  * This project implements `reverse()` as a method on the Linked List prototype; from your whiteboard exercise.
  * In this project I complete the Linked List data structure by adding a `removeNthNode(n)` method.
  * Within each function, I will note the Big-O runtime.

  * Any resources that helped me complete this assignment:
    - This stack overflow forum question about removing a node from the middle of a linked list:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39283662/remove-node-from-singly-linked-list

    - This tutorial was incredible for visualizing and understanding traversing through linked lists:

  * How another dev could 'get started' with this project:
    - Fork this repo.
    - Clone your fork.
    - Create a branch from your fork.

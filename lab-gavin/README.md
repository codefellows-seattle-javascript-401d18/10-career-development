# *VanillaJS Node Edition*


# Vanilla Javascript code to manipulate node data
[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()

## Project Description
Using basic vanilla Javascript I have created several methods that can be used to manipulate Node Data. Node data can be tricky and must use different methods than your conventional Javascript code. This is because Nodes don't know how many or really any other nodes except the one that comes directly after itself.

### Usage
This app is completely free to be used however you'd like!
After forking, downloading, and scripting these methods into your project you can simply call them as such

  + removeNthNode(node)
    + This will remove the node from a list of nodes with the desired value

  + reverse()
    + This will reverse the list of nodes

  + append(val)
    + This will append a new node at the end of the list of nodes

  + prepend(val)
    + This will append a new node at the beginning of the list of nodes
